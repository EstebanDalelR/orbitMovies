A test to get a job.

## Goal
To make a searchable UI for movies using [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), that has individual views for each result.

## Solution
In less than 1000 lines of code, and less than 6 hours, a full product was created and deployed.

## Stack
Everything was made using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and was deployed for free in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Result
The product is a mobile-first, server-side rendered searchable UI that preloads the Top and Popular movies, connected using both authentication methods that proves that no Angular is needed and that the job should be mine. 
Also, the pages gets a [perfect score in the speed test](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Forbit-movies.vercel.app%2F&tab=mobile).

## Live Page
You can see the live deploymentent [here](https://orbit-movies.vercel.app/).

## Caveats
- I'm a developer, so not much was done on the beauty side of things. 
- The search does not merge the results, so if you search for a Top or Popular movie, you will see two results come back.
