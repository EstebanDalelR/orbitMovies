# orbitMovies
A test to get a job.

## Goal
To make a searchable UI for movies using [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), that has individual views for each result.

## Solution
In less than 1000 lines of code, and less than 6 hours, a full product was created.

## Stack
Everything was made using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and was deployed for free in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Result
The product is a mobile-first, server-side rendered searchable UI for movies, connected using both authentication methods that proves that no Angular is needed and that the job should be mine.
